* I took the University of Michigan's "Python for Everybody" Coursera specialization between 4 April 2021 to 7 October 2021.
* Given that assignments were locked behind a paywall on Coursera but are free via Dr. Severance's [PY4E website](https://www.py4e.com), I used Coursera to track my progress on video lectures while using the PY4E website for autograder submissions.
* I didn't work on the course between 14 June 2021 until 17 August 2021 since I was staying in Pasir Laba Camp from June-July and was working on another course (UC Boulder's "Giving Helpful Feedback") during my MOH CTC stint in August. I resumed work for one day on 18 August 2021 but decided it was untenable to increase my workload further, so I resumed work on the course later on 26 September 2021.
